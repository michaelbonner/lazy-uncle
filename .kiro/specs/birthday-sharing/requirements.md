# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to share a link with friends and family members, allowing them to contribute birthday information that can then be selectively imported into the user's Lazy Uncle account. The system provides a collaborative approach to birthday collection with user control over what gets added to their personal birthday list.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user generates a sharing link THEN the system SHALL display the link with options to copy to clipboard or share via common methods
3. WHEN a user views their sharing links THEN the system SHALL show all active links with creation dates and expiration times
4. IF a user wants to revoke a sharing link THEN the system SHALL allow immediate deactivation of the link

### Requirement 2

6. WHEN multiple people use the same sharing link THEN the system SHALL allow multiple birthday submissions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Lazy Uncle user, I want to receive notifications when someone adds birthdays through my sharing link, so that I can promptly review and import the new information.

2. WHEN a user receives a birthday submission notification THEN the system SHALL include the submitter's information and birthday details
3. WHEN a user has multiple pending birthday submissions THEN the system SHALL provide a summary notification option
4. IF a user prefers no notifications THEN the system SHALL allow disabling of submission notifications in user settings

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Lazy Uncle user, I want to review and selectively import submitted birthdays, so that I can maintain control over what gets added to my personal birthday list.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has pending birthday submissions THEN the system SHALL display them in a dedicated review interface
2. WHEN reviewing submitted birthdays THEN the system SHALL show all submitted details including submitter information
3. WHEN a user wants to import a birthday THEN the system SHALL allow adding it to their personal birthday list with optional modifications
4. WHEN a user wants to reject a birthday submission THEN the system SHALL allow dismissing it without importing
5. WHEN importing a birthday THEN the system SHALL check for duplicates and warn the user if similar entries exist
6. WHEN a user imports multiple birthdays THEN the system SHALL provide bulk import options for efficiency
7. WHEN a birthday is imported or rejected THEN the system SHALL remove it from the pending submissions list

### Requirement 5

2. WHEN a user accesses sharing settings THEN the system SHALL allow setting notification preferences
3. WHEN a user accesses sharing settings THEN the system SHALL allow viewing and managing all active sharing links

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure birthday sharing is secure and prevents abuse, so that the feature can be safely used by all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria
