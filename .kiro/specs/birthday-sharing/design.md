# Birthday Sharing Feature Design

## Overview

The birthday sharing feature enables Lazy Uncle users to generate shareable links that allow friends and family to contribute birthday information. This collaborative approach streamlines birthday collection while maintaining user control over what gets imported into their personal birthday list.

The feature integrates with the existing Lazy Uncle architecture, leveraging the current Prisma/PostgreSQL database, GraphQL API, and Better Auth authentication system. The design emphasizes security, user experience, and seamless integration with existing birthday management workflows.

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

```mermaid

    A[User Dashboard] --> B[Share Link Generator]
    B --> C[Sharing Link Management]
    D[Public Sharing Form] --> E[Submission Storage]
    E --> F[Review Interface]
    F --> G[Import to Personal List]

    H[Notification System] --> A
    E --> H

    I[Security Layer] --> D
    I --> B
    I --> E
```

### Database Design

The feature extends the existing database schema with three new models:

**SharingLink Model:**

- Stores generated sharing links with expiration and security tokens
- Links to the user who created the link
- Tracks creation, expiration, and usage statistics

**BirthdaySubmission Model:**

- Stores birthday submissions from external contributors
- Contains all submitted birthday data plus metadata
- Links to the sharing link used for submission
- Tracks submission status (pending, imported, rejected)

**NotificationPreference Model:**

- Stores user preferences for sharing notifications
- Configurable notification types and delivery methods

### API Design

The feature extends the existing GraphQL API with new queries and mutations:

**Sharing Link Operations:**

- `createSharingLink`: Generate new sharing links
- `getSharingLinks`: Retrieve user's active sharing links
- `revokeSharingLink`: Deactivate sharing links
- `updateSharingSettings`: Modify sharing preferences

**Submission Operations:**

- `submitBirthday`: Public endpoint for birthday submissions
- `getPendingSubmissions`: Retrieve submissions awaiting review
- `importSubmission`: Import submission to personal birthday list
- `rejectSubmission`: Dismiss submission without importing

  userId      String
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  expiresAt   DateTime
  isActive    Boolean  @default(true)
  description String?

  user        User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  submissions BirthdaySubmission[]

  @@index([userId])
  @@index([token])
}

model BirthdaySubmission {
  id             String      @id @default(cuid())
  sharingLinkId  String
  name           String
  date           String
  category       String?
  notes          String?     @db.Text
  submitterName  String?
  submitterEmail String?
  relationship   String?
  status         SubmissionStatus @default(PENDING)
  createdAt      DateTime    @default(now())

  sharingLink    SharingLink @relation(fields: [sharingLinkId], references: [id])

  @@index([sharingLinkId])
  @@index([status])
}

model NotificationPreference {
  id                    String  @id @default(cuid())
  userId                String  @unique
  emailNotifications    Boolean @default(true)
  summaryNotifications  Boolean @default(false)

  user                  User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

enum SubmissionStatus {
  PENDING
  IMPORTED
  REJECTED
}
```

### GraphQL Schema Extensions

```graphql
type SharingLink {
  id: String!
  token: String!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  expiresAt: DateTime!
  isActive: Boolean!
  description: String
  submissionCount: Int!
}

type BirthdaySubmission {
  id: String!
  name: String!
  date: String!
  category: String
  notes: String
  submitterName: String
  submitterEmail: String
  relationship: String
  status: SubmissionStatus!
  createdAt: DateTime!
}

enum SubmissionStatus {
  PENDING
  IMPORTED
  REJECTED
}
```

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Error Handling

**Link Generation Errors:**

- Network failures during link creation
- Invalid expiration date selections
- Rate limiting exceeded

**Submission Form Errors:**

- Minimum token length of 32 characters with URL-safe encoding
- No predictable patterns in token generation

**Token Validation:**

- Constant-time string comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Automatic token invalidation on expiration
- Secure token storage with database indexing

### Rate Limiting

**Submission Rate Limiting:**

- IP-based rate limiting: 10 submissions per hour per IP
- Progressive delays for repeated violations
- Temporary IP blocking for severe abuse

**Link Generation Rate Limiting:**

- User-based limits: 5 active links per user maximum
- Daily generation limits: 3 new links per day per user
- Automatic cleanup of expired links

### Data Validation

**Input Sanitization:**

- HTML entity encoding for all text inputs
- Date format validation and normalization
- Email format validation for optional submitter emails

**SQL Injection Prevention:**

- Parameterized queries through Prisma ORM
- Input validation at GraphQL resolver level
- Type-safe database operations

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

**Indexing Strategy:**

- Composite indexes on frequently queried fields
- Partial indexes for active sharing links
- Regular index maintenance and analysis

**Query Optimization:**

- Efficient pagination for submission lists
- Optimized joins for related data fetching
- Database connection pooling

### Caching Strategy

**Link Validation Caching:**

- Redis cache for frequently accessed sharing links
- 5-minute TTL for link validation results
- Cache invalidation on link status changes

**Submission Data Caching:**

- Temporary caching of submission counts
- Cache warming for user dashboard data
- Efficient cache key strategies

### Background Processing

**Cleanup Operations:**

- Daily cleanup of expired sharing links
- Weekly cleanup of old rejected submissions
- Automated database maintenance tasks

**Notification Processing:**

- Asynchronous notification delivery
- Retry mechanisms for failed notifications
- Batch processing for summary notifications
