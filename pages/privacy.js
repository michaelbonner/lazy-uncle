      </p>

      <p>

        and store your information.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons
        and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about
        how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is
        set out in our Cookie Notice.
      </p>

      <p>5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?     </p>

      <p>
        In Short:  If you choose to register or log in to our services using a
        social media account, we may have access to certain information about
        you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our Services offers you the ability to register and login using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        Information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make
        public on such social media platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
        on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
        not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
        privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your
        personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
        their sites and apps.
      </p>

      <p>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

      <p>
        In Short:  We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill
        the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required
        by law.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>

      <p>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

      <p>
        In Short:  We aim to protect your personal information through a system
        of organizational and technical security measures.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
        storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
        promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
        third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
        collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
        our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should
        only access the Services within a secure environment.
      </p>

      <p>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>

      <p>
        In Short:  We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children
        under 18 years of age.
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
        years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least
        18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
        such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
        information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
        may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us
        at privacy@lazyuncle.net.
      </p>

      <p>9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

      <p>
        In Short:  You may review, change, or terminate your account at any
        time.
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we
        are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the
        right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.
        You can find their contact details
        here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data
        protection authorities are available

      <p>
        If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may
        email us at privacy@lazyuncle.net.
      </p>

      <p>Account Information</p>

      <p>
        If you would at any time like to review or change the information in
        your account or terminate your account, you can:
      </p>
      <p>▪ Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</p>

      <p>
        Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or
        delete your account and information from our active databases. However,
        we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud,
        troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms
        of Use and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept
        cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your
        browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove
        cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or
        services of our Services. To opt-out of interest-based advertising by
        advertisers on our Services visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.
      </p>

      <p>
        Opting out of email marketing: You can unsubscribe from our marketing
        email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails
        that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You
        will then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may
        still communicate with you, for example to send you service-related
        emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your
        account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing
        purposes. To otherwise opt-out, you may:
      </p>
      <p>▪ Access your account settings and update your preferences.</p>

      <p>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>

      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. 
      </p>

      <p>11. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

      <p>
        In Short:  Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted
        specific rights regarding access to your personal information.
      </p>

      <p>
        California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The
        Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request
        and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about
        categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third
        parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all
        third parties with which we shared personal information in the
        immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident
        and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in
        writing to us using the contact information provided below.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a
        registered account with a Service, you have the right to request removal
        of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request
        removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information
        provided below, and include the email address associated with your
        account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure
        the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware
        that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all
        our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).

        changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently
        posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a
        notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently
